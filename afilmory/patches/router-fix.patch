# Fix for duplicate route paths in Afilmory
# This patch should be applied to the Afilmory source after cloning

# You can manually apply this if needed:
# 1. Remove duplicate route definitions in the router config
# 2. Add HydrateFallback component for better hydration
# 3. Update deprecated meta tags

# Note: These are warnings/errors from the original Afilmory codebase
# and don't affect the basic functionality of the photo gallery
